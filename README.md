# Author Hub

## Introduction

Best described as the GitHub for authors, AuthorHub is an application for authors to share ideas and get feedback from a variety of places. Editors can offer their skills to authors via an "apply to collaborate" button, which offers them access to the project. Of course the application wouldn't be complete without an abundance of readers to give their thoughts via a forum that can be found on any author's published works.
